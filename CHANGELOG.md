## Unreleased

### Phase 2 — signing in, the inbox lifecycle, and both surfaces

**What.** `@cloudpixel/gmail` — the `agent-gmail` command and the MCP server — and
`@cloudpixel/gmail-mcp`, the server as its own package:

- signing a mailbox in: loopback redirect on 127.0.0.1 with PKCE, and a **two-step flow** (`inbox add --start`
  prints the link and leaves a detached listener; `inbox add --finish` collects the result) because consent takes
  minutes and an agent's shell does not last that long;
- checks that run after consent and before anything is stored: what was actually granted (people can untick boxes),
  and which account it turned out to be — a sign-in as the wrong account, or one that cannot read, writes nothing;
- `client add|list|remove` (Desktop clients only, credentials checked with Google before they are stored),
  `inbox add|list|show|reauth|rename|policy|remove|import`, `whoami`, `doctor`, `mcp`, `mcp install`;
- `inbox import` copies mailboxes out of another Gmail MCP server, and says plainly that while that server is still
  connected an agent can send mail with none of the approval steps here;
- `doctor` checks Node, directory permissions, the secret store, every mailbox's sign-in and permissions — and
  **other Gmail MCP servers registered on this machine**, each with the command that fixes it;
- the MCP server: `gmail_inboxes_list`, `gmail_whoami`, `gmail_doctor`, a tool list that never varies between
  connections, permission checks that re-run on every call, and results carried in both `structuredContent` and one
  text block so every client sees them;
- `mcp install` writes the entry with an absolute interpreter path and an explicit environment (clients start
  servers with a minimal PATH), then starts the server through that exact entry to prove it works;
- settings written by a newer version are preserved rather than dropped when an older one writes the file, so two
  versions sharing a machine cannot silently undo each other;
- on Windows, tokens, approvals and the audit log move out of the roaming profile (`%APPDATA%`) into
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, which a domain does not copy between machines.

**Why.** Everything else in this project needs a mailbox connected and a way for an agent to reach it. The parts
that took the most care are the ones that fail quietly: the account you did not mean to authorise, the permission
you did not notice was missing, and the second Gmail server that can send mail without asking.

**Impact.** **Nothing to install yet.** No package is published. Developing in this repository needs Node 22.18 or
newer; the packages themselves will run on 22.12 or newer.
- **Tests:** `pnpm verify` — root 14, comms-core 131, gmail 54, gmail-mcp 3, and a packed-tarball consumer check per
  package (the MCP one completes a real `initialize` and `tools/list` over stdio).

### Phase 1 — the foundation and the core

**What.** The foundation for 0.1.0: the design (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-18-agent-communications-design.md`)
and the implementation plan, the repository scaffolding (pnpm workspace, TypeScript 7, tsdown, Biome, CI on Linux,
macOS and Windows, security policy, contribution guide, issue forms, Blocks review config), a skill verifier, and
`@cloudpixel/comms-core` — the provider-neutral core every other package builds on:

- config with immutable inbox ids, locked writes and user intent kept apart from runtime state;
- one secret backend per config directory: the OS keychain (Linux pinned to Secret Service; a call that an OS
  prompt holds up fails after 12 seconds instead of hanging a background server) or owner-only files;
- the approval engine that will gate every send: records bound to the inbox, the account, the draft's message id
  and a content digest; a compare-and-swap state machine plus an exclusive claim file, so an approval is used at most
  once across processes; any edit to the draft voids it; challenges a human types are stored only as hashes;
- a config store that refuses any change loosening a safety setting unless a person consented at a terminal;
- a shared send ledger for rate caps, single-use plan tokens for bulk changes, and a taint store for recipients
  that appeared only in email content;
- the untrusted-content envelope and an HTML sanitiser that removes what a mail client would not show (and reports
  it), plus a preview renderer that stops a draft from forging the recipient lines a human approves;
- path jails for downloads and attachments; the audit log; the `agentcomms` command.

**Why.** Every Gmail scope that allows drafting also allows sending, so "never send without approval" has to be
enforced in code, in one place, before any Gmail code exists.

**Impact.** **Nothing to install yet.** No package is published. Developing in this repository needs Node 22.18 or
newer; the packages themselves will run on 22.12 or newer.
- **Tests:** `pnpm verify` — root 14 passing, comms-core 164 passing, and a packed-tarball consumer check.
